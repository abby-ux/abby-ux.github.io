        <h2>üëã Hi, I'm Abby</h2>
        <p>
          I am a second year student at Northeastern University studying Computer Science.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently I am creating my newest website, Kara.io, and learning the MERN stack.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am interested in web development because it is a great way to solve problems and 
          create fun and useful products.
        </p>

      </section> 

      <section>
        <h2>üíª Skills</h2>
        <p>
          I am proficient in Java, JS/HTML/CSS, and C. I enjoy using React, Express, Postgresql and Node.js 
          for most of my projects currently. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I have taken courses in algorithms and data structures, databases, mathematics of data models, and computer systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Languages: Java, C, JavaScript, HTML/CSS | Frameworks: React, Node.js, Vue.js, WordPress, Three.js | 
Developer Tools: Git, VS Code, Eclipse | Operating Systems: Windows, Ubuntu Linux
        </p>

        <h2>ü•Ö Personal Goals</h2>
        <p>
          I want to keep improving my programming skills so that I can create software that will
          make a positive impact in the world. I would love to work at a company that values making a positive impact 
          by creating products that make our lives easy and our daily tasks more convenient. 
        </p>

        <p>
          A big goal of mine this year is to collaborate on programming projects, as I tend to 
          work solo as of now.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently learning the MERN stack and I hope to master that eventually. Next, I would 
          like to learn python and make some projects with the language.
        </p>
